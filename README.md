# Find the cheapeast gas station in your area

In this project I created a Map that shows me, which gas station is the cheapest (and the most expensive) one, based on my location and the range I want to consider. 
I consumed the (almost) real-time gas station prices via [this API Endpoint](https://creativecommons.tankerkoenig.de/)     

To display those gas stations, I used JavaScript and this [map.](https://docs.mapbox.com/api/overview/)
